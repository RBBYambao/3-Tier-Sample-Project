COE125-C1-Group01-Design of Experiment

The project is supposed to make use of the capabilities of modern machine along with a camera in order to process, learn, and identify an object on its own. By doing so, we would be able to provide a useful software in which it would be a great use for image processing and for projects that involves machine learning, face detection, and tracking.Â 

Scope 

              The project does not work on mac OS and it might require a good laptop specification in order to work properly. The program can only accept live data as input and cannot process images for detection. 

  

Overviews 

              The group would like to create a program that can detect an object and classify it with a label using TensorFlow, which is used for machine learning applications such as neural networks. The program will be written and implanted using Python. The program can only accept live data as input, which means that it cannot detect object when the input is an image. 

 

Basic Functional Requirements: 

The program makes use of a camera. 

It should be able to identify objects even if they are partially covered. 

Must be able to learn new objects by giving it reference images for the program to learn. 

The project should be scalable meaning additional hardware should be easy to integrate  

Human Interface Requirements: 

The GUI must be intuitive instead of simple and easy to use.  

The GUI must present a clean interface that is working properly and handles errors efficiently.  

Error messages should be logged.  

The GUI should not be cluttered with unnecessary options.  

Interface Requirements: 

Accept images as entry. 

Label the detected object. 

Can detect different objects. 

Regulatory Requirements: 

The text file will contain labels for detection. 

Basic Non-functional Requirements: 

Must run on Windows or Linux with compatible hardware. 

Implemented using Python. 

Undesirable Characteristics: 

Needs some good hardware requirements such as a good processor. 

It requires several steps to install and set up the program. 

Takes a lot of work to provide a picture for the program to use for learning. 

In the event of requiring maintenance or repair, the hardware should be straightforward to service  

The hardware must require minimum maintenance.  

Cost and Time Constraints: 

The entire project should cost no more than at most 10 weeks. 

The input data should only be able to identify objects based on trained data.  

Web Camera Requirements: 

The clarity which the camera will be able to detect the given image. Stable and non-moving/blurred image will be required. Specific resolution of the camera enables higher performance in image detection.
